Deploying
=================

## Technical Requirements

Before creating your first Symfony application you must:

* Install PHP 7.2.5 or higher and these PHP extensions (which are installed and enabled by default in most PHP 7 installations): 
[Ctype](https://www.php.net/book.ctype), [iconv](https://www.php.net/book.iconv), [JSON](https://www.php.net/book.json),[PCRE](https://www.php.net/book.pcre), [Session](https://www.php.net/book.session), [SimpleXML](https://www.php.net/book.simplexml), and [Tokenizer](https://www.php.net/book.tokenizer);
    
* Install [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/), which is used to install PHP packages.

* Optionally, you can also [install Symfony CLI](https://symfony.com/download). This creates a binary called symfony that provides all the tools you need to develop and 
run your Symfony application locally.

* The symfony binary also provides a tool to check if your computer meets all requirements. Open your console terminal and run this command:

        symfony check:requirements
